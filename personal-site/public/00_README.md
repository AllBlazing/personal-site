Vision:
As a solopreneur, I aim to build 12 sustainable AI-driven projects in 12 months, each designed to serve and empower the Hyrox community. My goal is to independently build, manage, and market these micro-businesses while ensuring they are scalable, automated, and profit-focused.

Each project should:
	â€¢	Deliver clear value to hybrid athletes or fitness enthusiasts
	â€¢	Be simple to maintain, with minimal external dependencies
	â€¢	Prioritize automated workflows to reduce manual effort
	â€¢	Use lean, well-documented code that I can understand and edit myself
	â€¢	Encourage rapid iteration while minimizing technical debt

ðŸ’¡ Why this version? It adds structure (what, who, how), adds sustainability goals (maintainable code), and makes Cursor more likely to follow a lean, focused dev path.

âœ… Step 2: Key Rules for Cursor to Follow

These are designed to prevent scope creep, maintain clarity, and ensure your autonomy over the codebase:

â¸»

Rule 1: Write Clear, Minimal Code

Keep all code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python) easy to understand and maintain.
âž¤ Avoid unnecessary frameworks, dependencies, or bloat.
âž¤ Favor vanilla JavaScript and lightweight libraries only when needed.

â¸»

Rule 2: Add Meaningful Comments

Every function, variable group, and CSS rule must include a brief but clear comment explaining its purpose.
âž¤ Pretend youâ€™re writing for a motivated non-coder who wants to learn.

â¸»

Rule 3: Ask Before You Change Existing Code

Do not alter existing code or introduce new files without explicitly asking for permission first.
âž¤ If you think something needs refactoring or extending, suggest it and wait for confirmation.

â¸»

Rule 4: Respect Project Scope

Stick to the original scope of each feature or file.
âž¤ Do not add extra pages, modules, or design elements unless explicitly requested.
âž¤ Minimize third-party packages and plugins.

â¸»

Rule 5: Build for Automation

Wherever possible, suggest automated solutions that reduce manual workâ€”e.g. content generation, analytics, email outreach, or progress tracking.
âž¤ Focus on tools and workflows that can scale with minimal intervention.

â¸»

Rule 6: UX-First, Athlete-Centric

Always consider the user experience from the lens of a hybrid athlete or coach.
âž¤ Design and interactions should be mobile-first, intuitive, and focused on reducing cognitive load.
