Step 2: Key Rules for Cursor to Follow

These are designed to prevent scope creep, maintain clarity, and ensure your autonomy over the codebase:

⸻

Rule 1: Write Clear, Minimal Code

Keep all code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python) easy to understand and maintain.
➤ Avoid unnecessary frameworks, dependencies, or bloat.
➤ Favor vanilla JavaScript and lightweight libraries only when needed.

⸻

Rule 2: Add Meaningful Comments

Every function, variable group, and CSS rule must include a brief but clear comment explaining its purpose.
➤ Pretend you’re writing for a motivated non-coder who wants to learn.

⸻

Rule 3: Ask Before You Change Existing Code

Do not alter existing code or introduce new files without explicitly asking for permission first.
➤ If you think something needs refactoring or extending, suggest it and wait for confirmation.

⸻

Rule 4: Respect Project Scope

Stick to the original scope of each feature or file.
➤ Do not add extra pages, modules, or design elements unless explicitly requested.
➤ Minimize third-party packages and plugins.

⸻

Rule 5: Build for Automation

Wherever possible, suggest automated solutions that reduce manual work—e.g. content generation, analytics, email outreach, or progress tracking.
➤ Focus on tools and workflows that can scale with minimal intervention.

⸻

Rule 6: UX-First, Athlete-Centric

Always consider the user experience from the lens of a hybrid athlete or coach.
➤ Design and interactions should be mobile-first, intuitive, and focused on reducing cognitive load.
